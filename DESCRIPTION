Description: Provides tools for detecting maximal partial cliques in adjacency matrices, 
    suitable for use in bioinformatics and network analysis. The package implements 
    functions to generate synthetic graphs with predefined properties, compute maximal 
    partial cliques based on density thresholds, and validate graph properties. The 
    implementation focuses on educational purposes, illustrating computational techniques 
    in graph theory as applied to biological data.
